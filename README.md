# PHOENIX: Misconfiguration Detection for AWS Serverless Computing

This work has been accepted for publication in Transactions on Cloud Computing 2025!

We provide the used dataset, code of our tool PHOENIX, and evaluation data.

!!!We provide new experiments and results in the directory **NewAddExperimentData**.

1. The LLM-related implementations: **Simple_LLM.py**, **Three_Few_shot_LLM.py**, and **LLM Results.xlsx**

2. The compared pattern mining algorithm (N Painting Growth algorithm) implementation: **AWSRuleMiningUsingN-Painting.ipynb**

3. The evaluation dataset and the detection results of our approach and AWS SAM CLI: **injected misconfiguration information-updatedResults.xlsx** and **realworld problem information-update.xlsx**


## Used dataset

The used dataset is saved in the directory "Dataset".

- The directory "configuration files-real" contains **733 real-world configuration files** with 701 configuration files from 658 serverless applications in AWS SAR and 32 configuration cases from GitHub.
    - The detailed information of these real-world configuration files is described in the file "real dataset info.xlsx".
    - They are used to conduct a study in Section 3 and learn the patterns of our tool PHOENIX.

- The directory "configuration files-office" contains sample configuration files provided in the official documentation.
    - The detailed information of these examples is partially described in the file "official dataset info.xlsx".
    - They are used to learn the patterns of our tool PHOENIX.



## Code of our tool PHOENIX

The required libraries in our tool are recorded in the file "requirement.txt". 

#### Data collection, data conversion, and pattern mining

- The dataset collection includes two scripts:
    - AWS SAR dataset: the code file "Get_sar.py" can collect relevant AWS serverless applications.
    - GitHub issue dataset: the code file "Get_github_issue.py" can collect relevant GitHub issues.
- The learned patterns are saved in the directory "Patterns".
- The code file "AWSupdate_data.ipynb" can learn the patterns about configuration resource types, configuration entries, and configuration entry values.
- The code file "AWSRuleMining.ipynb" can learn the patterns about coarse-grained and fine-grained configuration dependencies.
- The code file "GeneralMethod.py" contains some general method implementation.

#### Misconfiguration Detection

- The code file "approachAWS.ipynb" conducts misconfiguration detection for a tested configuration file of the serverless application.
- The learned patterns can be read only once, and then the tests are constantly carried out on the configuration file to be tested.



## Evaluation data


- Experimental evaluation 1 for 35 injected misconfigurations on 20 correct configuration files that are newly selected.
    - The directory "correct file" includes 20 correct configuration files, from EvaluationFile1.yaml to EvaluationFile20.yaml.
    - The specific links about 20 correct configuration files and corresponding injected strategies are provided in the file "injected misconfiguration information.xlsx"


- Experimental evaluation 2 for 70 real-world misconfigurations that are newly selected from GitHub. 
    - The specific links of these configuration problems are provided in the file "realworld problem information.xlsx".
